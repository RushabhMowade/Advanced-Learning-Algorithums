# **Coffee Roasting in TensorFlow Model**
This project focuses on building a prediction model, "Coffee Roasting predictive model ". The model uses two features, Temperature in Celsius and Duration in minutes, to predict the probability of achieving a good coffee roast. The project follows the guidelines provided by "Coffee Roasting at Home," aiming for a duration between 12 and 15 minutes and a temperature between 175 and 260 degrees Celsius. The model outputs probabilities, and a threshold of 0.5 is applied to make binary decisions.
